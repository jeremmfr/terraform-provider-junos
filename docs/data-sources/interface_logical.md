# junos_interface_logical

Get information on a logical interface  
(as with a junos_interface_logical resource import).

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Search interface with IP
data "junos_interface_logical" "demo_ip" {
  match = "192.0.2.2/"
}
# Search interface with name
data "junos_interface_logical" "interface_fw_demo" {
  config_interface = "ge-0/0/3.0"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- **config_interface** (Optional, String)  
  Specifies the interface part for search.  
  Command is `show configuration interfaces <config_interface>`
- **match** (Optional, String)  
  Regex string to filter lines and find only one interface.

~> **NOTE:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search, Terraform will fail.
