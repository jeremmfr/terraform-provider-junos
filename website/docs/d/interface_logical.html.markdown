# junos_interface_logical

Get information on a logical interface

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Search interface with IP
data junos_interface_logical "demo_ip" {
  match = "192.0.2.2/"
}
# Search interface with name
data junos_interface_logical "interface_fw_demo" {
  config_interface = "ge-0/0/3.0"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `config_interface` - (Optional)(`String`) Specifies the interface part for search. Command is 'show configuration interfaces <config_interface>'
* `match` - (Optional)(`String`) Regex string to filter lines and find only one interface.

~> **NOTE:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search, Terraform will fail.
